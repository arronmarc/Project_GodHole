Alpha 2.5D allows you to draw sprites and tilemaps in a 2.5D perspective.

*** USAGE ***

- Sprites -
Draw sprites using the draw_sprite_3D and draw_sprite_3D_ext functions.
Use them ass you would the regular sprite drawing functions.


- Tilemaps -
To use tilemaps, you must first create a tileset.

To create a tileset, create a new tileset3D object.
Once created, you need to call generate_uvs() on the tileset.
This is necessary for rendering.

Now, create a tilemap3D object.
Call generate_tilemaps() on the new tilemap.
Then call draw() to render it.

Tilemaps have a top and a wall.

Tilesets start index at 0 and go in reading order (left to right, top to bottom).


- Tilemap data -
The tilemap data is constructed as follows:
	tiles = [top [row [col, col], row []], wall [row [col, col], row []]]

The first array contains 2 arrays, one for the top and one for the wall.
Those arrays contains arrays for rows.
Rows then contain collums.

To have an empty cell, put -1. All other values will be rendered.
If you go outside the bounds of the tileset however, the game will crash.

If you only want the wall or the top, leave the other array empty like so:
	tiles = [[], [[0, 1, 2]]] - will only render a wall
	tiles = [[[0, 1, 2]], []] - will only render a floor
	
*Note : You have to call destroy() on a tilemap when done using it
otherwise it will cause a memory leak.


- Tile layers -
To render tile layers in 3D, call init_tile_layers() at the start of the room.
Tile layers will be rendered using their depth as their z position.

Tile layers are only drawn as floors.
To make walls, use 3D tilemaps.

- Other -
Important to note: The lower z is, the cloaser it is to the camera.

SHADOWS
Shadows not drawing properly because I'm using 
draw_sprite_part to draw the player object, would
need to change how I draw that to work.

Shadows work when specified on specific objects
in depthsorter draw event but need to find way to have
them draw on everything. Can't use par_depthobject as
parent because it doesn't have a sprite. Maybe there is
a function to say "draw children sprites"?

BULLETS
Bullets collide with obj_collision at different angles
based on direction. At larger angles they go through to
the back of the object.
No idea why.
